# New semester TODO list

## Current House List Google Sheet

We use [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bm_qpASyb6iXwqws_vf6wV0R1byJ-L-AeyVmPRTrVqE/edit#gid=2080866884) to update the house list with the spreadsheets we get from central.

### Diff Worksheet
First, we make sure to preserve any changes people have made to the email they use for Cloyne:

1. Copy the list of subscribers from the [announce list on sympa](http://cloyne.org/lists/review/announce)
2. Paste it into the `Sympa Dump` tab in the Google Sheet
3. Now the `Sympa Dump` sheet has a column with everybody's current emails and everybody's names. Copy each of these columns to overwrite the orange columns ("old house list") on the `Diff Worksheet` tab of the Google Sheet.
4. Clear the white columns under the blue heading to make room for the new houselist. *Do not modify the light blue columns* unless you know what you're doing (i.e., the formulas are broken). Paste in the names and emails from central. The light blue columns should autopopulate
5. For any returning members whose names are missing on Sympa, copy the correctly formatted name into the blank cell in the sympa name column.
6. Copy the emails to the column to the right of all the colored columns, and change any emails that are different on the central list to match the Cloyne version.
7. Copy the names column to the next column to the right of the new email column.
8. Re-add any coordinator accounts who had signed up for announce but are not on the house list - including the facilities manager and anyone else who shows up in the old sympa list.

This is the list we will use for updating Sympa, below.

### RocketChat Worksheet
In the `Rocketchat` tab on the Google Sheet:

1. Copy the names into the first few columns from the `Diff Worksheet`
2. Log into [chat.cloyne.org](chat.cloyne.org), go to three dot menu -> admnistration -> users, and copy the table of users. You may have to page through.
3. Paste that table into the middle section of the `Rocketchat` tab in the Google sheet, overwriting the existing contents. Make sure to delete any extra residual rows if there are fewer users this term.
4. Spot check th last columns to make sure usernames generated properly.
5. If available, paste the list of coordinator emails into the `Coords` sheet

## RocketChat

Using the generated lins from the rocketchat worksheet (above), follow the directions [here](https://github.com/cloyne/docker-rocketchat/wiki/Prepare-Rocket.Chat-for-a-New-Semester) to update RocketChat. 

## Facebook

* Create a Facebook group, name `Cloyne SEASON 'XX`, where `SEASON` is one of `Fall`, `Spring`, `Summer`, and
`XX` is year, like `Cloyne Summer '15`.
* In settings, change the url to end with `cloyne.XXXXyy` where XXXX is the year
    and yy is the season.
* Share it on previous semester Facebook group so that people can join with a pinned message on top of the group. Invite those you know their Facbook account.
* Allow joining only to members who live that semester in Cloyne.
* Ask for the new cover photo for the new group.

Examples of past Facebook groups: [Cloyne Summer '15](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1479825148929634/),
[Cloyne Spring '15](https://www.facebook.com/groups/765891660172376/),
[Cloyne Fall '14](https://www.facebook.com/groups/628905887204288/)

We also have an [alumni Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CloyneAlumni/).

## Mailing lists

For mailing list we use [Sympa](http://sympa.org/) installed at [http://cloyne.org/lists/](http://cloyne.org/lists/).
Tasks at the beginning of the semester are:
* Copy current `clones@cloyne.org` mailing list to `clones.XXX@cloyne.org` mailing list, where `XXX` consist of a
year and season, like `clones.2014f@cloyne.org`, `clones.2015s@cloyne.org` or `clones.2015su@cloyne.org` (for summer).
* Remove old members from `announce@cloyne.org` mailing list and add current members.
* Update `clones@cloyne.org` mailing list to add current members.
* Update `alumni@cloyne.org` mailing list to include the new `clones.XXX@cloyne.org` mailing list as data source.

### Detailed steps:
* Prepare a list of current members e-mail addresses in the format `EMAIL NAME` with each entry in the separate line.
So e-mail address is separated from name with a space, and each e-mail address is in its own line.
See the house list google doc for spreadsheet magic, or use regular expressions.
**Make sure there are no commas in names.** (This can confuse a CSV file later on.)
Add the facilities manager's email and name to the end of the list.
* Login with `clonm@bsc.coop` account [http://cloyne.org/lists/](http://cloyne.org/lists/).

#### Archive clones:
* Open [http://cloyne.org/lists/create_list_request](http://cloyne.org/lists/create_list_request).
* Choose to copy `clones@cloyne.org` mailing list as `clones.XXX@cloyne.org`. We are preparing now the archived mailing
list. This copies the configuration, including auto-populating the subscriber list from announce.
* Open the "Manage Subscribers" admin page of the new `clones.XXX@cloyne.org` mailing list, for example for
`clones.2015s@cloyne.org` open `http://cloyne.org/lists/review/clones.2015s`.
    * Click on the "Synchronize members with data sources" button for the copied list.
* Open the "List definition" admin page of the new mailing list, for example for
`clones.2015s@cloyne.org` open `http://cloyne.org/lists/edit_list_request/clones.2015s/description`.
    * Hover over "Edit List Config" and click on "Data sources setup." Find the lists section, select all lists listed there, and check their "delete" boxes. Hit update at the very bottom of the page.
    * Change subject "Cloyne discussion mailing list" (which is subject for `clones@cloyne.org` mailing list) to
`Cloyne YEAR SEASON discussion mailing list`, like `Cloyne 2015 spring discussion mailing list`
    * Change "visibility" to "conceal except for subscribers".
    * Scroll down and change "Topics" to "Alumni and returning clones".
    * Click "Update" at the end of the page.
* Go to Edit list config -> data sources setup, check the "delete" box next to the announce@cloyne.org entry, and click update. This will freeze the list membership.

#### Update announce:
* Open [http://cloyne.org/lists/review/announce](http://cloyne.org/lists/review/announce).
* Copy the current house list to the "Sympa dump" page of the house list spreadsheet,
    and extract the names/emails to use in the "Diff Worksheet" page. This is
    necessary to ensure that people who've changed what email they use for
    Cloyne, have that preference carry over to the new semester.
* Back in Sympa, remove all subscribers by clicking on "Toggle selection" at the end of the page to select all, check "Quiet",
and then click on "Delete selected email addresses".
* Open [http://cloyne.org/lists/add_request/announce](http://cloyne.org/lists/add_request/announce).
* Paste in all addresses, check "Quiet", and click on "Add subscribers".

`from-central` mailing list is automatically updated based on the subscribers from `announce` mailing list.

#### Set up new clones list
* Go to https://cloyne.org/lists/review/clones
* Click "Synchronize Data Sources"

#### Update the alumni list
* Open [http://cloyne.org/lists/edit_list_request/alumni/data_source](http://cloyne.org/lists/edit_list_request/alumni/data_source).
* Add to "List inclusion" the new `clones.XXX` mailing list inclusion. For example, `clones.2015s`.
Click "Update" at the end of the page.

## Wordpress

* [Using this script](https://github.com/cloyne/docker-blog/blob/master/users-csv.py) you can create a CSV file from a list of e-mail addresses and names, the same as used for mailing lists.
```bash
./users-csv.py < list > out.csv
```

* All users in the CSV file will be created with `author` permission which allows them to post blog posts, events,
upload media content, but does not allow them to change content of others.
* Open [http://cloyne.org/wp-admin/users.php?page=import-users-from-csv](http://cloyne.org/wp-admin/users.php?page=import-users-from-csv).
* Select the CSV file, check "Send to new users" and "Show password nag on new users signon". Click "Import".

It might happen that the site time-outs after the import. This is normal. New users will be imported and e-mail
notification will be send to them inviting them to set the password.

## Notifying members

After all of the above was done, you should send a message to members informing them what is available to them and
how to use it.

### The `announce@cloyne.org` e-mail template:

Welcome to Cloyne from your network coordinator! I've updated the mailing lists for the new contract period. We have three main lists to which everyone is subscribed initially:

  * announce@cloyne.org - managers will use this to send announcements to all house members.
  * clones@cloyne.org - discussion mailing list for all of us to keep virtual flow of information going, any discussion goes, but remember that the whole house is subscribed to this mailing list (if needed, feel free to request a dedicated mailing list for your project, group, team, interests, etc., so that members can subscribe to those they are interested in)
  * from-central@cloyne.org - similar to announce, just that for information from the central level we are forwarding to the house

If you want to change your e-mail address you are subscribed to mailing lists with, you can do that by visiting:
http://cloyne.org/lists/firstpasswd/. After you login, visit your account preferences and change your e-mail address:
http://cloyne.org/lists/pref

We also have a collective "Cloyne Cloaca" email account which is mainly used to send announcements from the kitchen.  Because it can be used by anyone, anonymously, it can also be misused.  Do not trust everything coming from it.

I strongly recommend setting up filters to keep your mailing lists manageable - especially separating [cloann] from [clones]. If you prefer to keep all of your email in one place, you can also mute individual conversations to make a particular thread stop showing up in your inbox every time someone replies to it. I recommend the following settings:

  * for the announce mailing list, create a label and filter it under that label, but don't select "skip the inbox"
  * for clones and other mailing lists, either:
      * use mute feature to mute conversations you are not interested in, or
      * create a label and filter for it and set that it skips the inbox and is automatically archived, and then only check that label when you want to see what's happening on [clones].

Stay tuned for more exciting emails about (y)our collective network resources, including: our website/blog, our file server, our google calendar, and workshift opportunities!
In solidarity,

### The `clones.XXX@cloyne.org` e-mail template:

The clones@cloyne.org mailing list has been renamed to clones.2019f@cloyne.org
with all the members from 2019 Fall kept there.

The new clones@cloyne.org mailing list has only the spring members on it.

There is also an alumni@cloyne.org mailing list, which is a superset of all
clones.*@cloyne.org mailing lists, so all past members of Cloyne since 2014.

Feel free to use them. Feel free to unsubscribe. Feel free to change the e-mail
address with which you are subscribed. You can do that by visiting:

http://cloyne.org/lists/firstpasswd/

And after you login, visit your account preferences and change your e-mail
address:

http://cloyne.org/lists/pref

We also have an alumni Facebook group. Feel free to join it:

https://www.facebook.com/groups/CloyneAlumni

Cheers,

Note: If you just want to unsubscribe, the fastest way is to send an email to
sympa@cloyne.org with the subject "SIGNOFF clones.2019f" for just this list, or
"SIGNOFF *" for all lists.

### What is makerspace:

Note: the makerspace now has its own coordinator position. This template is from
when it was called the hackerspace. It's preserved here for historical
purposes.

```
What makerspace is. In short, it is a space where you can work on your
projects, be creative. Hacking here means in some way taking things
apart, learning how they work, building things from other stuff, often
stuff which had originally some other purpose. And it does not have to
be at all related to computer science, you can hack law, philosophy,
clothes, privilege.

So, no, hackers do *not* look like that:

http://www.sadanduseless.com/2011/12/stock-photo-hackers/

I think you should all see this great talk by Mitch about what
hackerspaces are above:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkiX7R1-kaY

Mitch was also at Cloyne, having a soldering workshop:

http://cloyne.org/events/soldering-workshop/

Look at us:

http://cloyne.org/2014/09/report-soldering-with-mitch-altman/

So, space is for you and your creativity!
```

# Instructions

Later on you should send few e-mails with various instructions.

## `Adding events to your Google Calendar` template

```
If you want, you can add events from cloyne.org website to your Google
Calendar. On events page you have iCal link:

http://cloyne.org/events/

Copy the URL and add it to your Google Calendar as described for you
on the following page under the section "Example: Subscribing to
Events Using Google Calendar":

http://wp-events-plugin.com/documentation/event-ical-feeds/
```

## `How to use Gmail for mailing lists` template

```
Do you feel overwhelmed with all the e-mails coming your way over our
mailing lists? Are you using Gmail? Worry not, there are some easy tricks to empower you and get you in charge of which discussions you
want to read and which to ignore.

There are two ways of dealing with mailing list:
- you can label and filter them
- or you can mute individual conversations you don't want to appear in
your inbox anymore

You can get the whole mailing list be filtered under one label. instructions:

http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/11/filter-messages-from-mailing-list-in.html

Gmail has support for muting one conversation:

https://support.google.com/mail/answer/47787?hl=en

You mute it once (when you discover that topic does not interest you)
and this is it.

"When you mute a conversation, new messages added to the conversation
bypass your inbox so that the conversation stays archived."

I propose the following settings:
- for announce mailing list, create a label and filter it under that
e-mail, but leave e-mails to come to you inbox
- for clones and other mailing lists, or:
  - use mute feature to mute conversations you are not interested in, or
  - you create a label and filter for it and set that it skips the
inbox and is automatically archived

If you have any questions about any of this, feel free to ask.
```

## `Everyone can post to our blog and create events` template

```
Short reminder that if anyone would like to post to a blog at
cloyne.org or create an event, you can do that! You should all
receive username you can use to login into the site. If not,
register here:

http://cloyne.org/wp-login.php?action=register

And then send me an e-mail that I give you permissions. After that,
you can make blog posts and events through admin interface:

http://cloyne.org/wp-admin/

For now, we do not have any rules what blog posts are OK, and I like
that, so let's try for now like that. If anyone feels that anything
published is objectionable, feel empowered to bring it up to or author
or managers.

Otherwise, I would really encourage all of you to take it for your own
media. Post blog posts of what you are doing, what you are proud of,
what interesting happened, anything you would like to share with house
and visitors of our website. Make it fun, sad, serious, [insert your
favorite adjective], make it yours.

Create events. By creating an event, you inform the rest of the house
that something is happening, and you also clearly show that the space
will be in use.
```

## `Scanning and printing` template
TODO. this is out of date.

```
We have a house scanner and printer. Printing operates on karma box
principle, 5 cents per page. When printing, please throw that amount
into the karma box next to the printer.

Scanning is easy, you can scan it to the USB flash drive.

For printing, you have multiple ways you can print. The easiest is to
configure it on your computer as a network printer.

Open the printer configuration on your computer and it will probably
find this printer; otherwise, you can add it with the following
information:
- name: [Pool Room] Brother MFC-9340CDW
- type: Brother MFC-9340CDW
- IP Address: 10.20.32.90
- address: printer1.cloyne.org

If prompted, do not select "share printer".

Alternativelly, you can plug your USB flash drive from the front.

And remember, always print *two-sided to save paper*! Or even multiple
pages on one page. You configure that on your computer when you are
printing.
```
